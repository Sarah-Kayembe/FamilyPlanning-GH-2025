# Digital Family Planning Register for Ghana Health Service

## Project Description

This project aims to replace Ghanaâ€™s paper-based family planning register with a digital system. The platform is designed to:

- Help nurses efficiently track family planning services.
- Simplify the transition to new yearly forms.
- Automatically generate Monthly Family Planning reports.

The system improves accuracy, speeds up record-keeping, and enhances data accessibility across the Ghana Health Service.

## AI Use During Project

We used AI tools responsibly to accelerate development while maintaining human oversight:

- **ChatGPT**: Assisted with code generation, debugging and writing documentation drafts.
- **DeepSeek**: Assisted with code generation, and debugging Java Swing, used for UI.

All AI-generated suggestions were reviewed and modified by team members to ensure they aligned with the use cases.
