# FamilyPlanning-GH-2025
Building a digital system to replace Ghanaâ€™s paper-based family planning register. This system will help nurses track family planning services, smoothly transition to new yearly forms, and generate Monthly Family Planning reports with ease. The goal is to make record-keeping faster, more accurate, and more accessible for the Ghana Health Service.
